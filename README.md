# SDR-Marine-Scanner
Hello, This is my B.tech Final year Major project "**Design and Development of SDR based Marine VHF Scanner**".
I have primarly used the GNU Radio and AIS-catcher FOSS community softwares for detection of marine vessels.This project involves creating a robust system for efficient tracking of the Marine Vessels.
In this project I have also included the python module (for repetive scanning across the specified VHF range) in GNURadio interface which works efficiently for real-time detection of vessels.
